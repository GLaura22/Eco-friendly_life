This winform app calculates the carbon footprint of preparing certain dishes. 
The user can filter the dishes by ingredients, and the app recommends the recipe of the food that satisfies the parameters the most and
has the lowest carbon footprint out of the accessible options.
Here's a link to a youtube video that shows how the app works: https://youtu.be/WwfJXhz_WCM
